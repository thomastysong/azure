# Intune Client Library

This library provides a simple interface for managing Microsoft Intune device
configuration profiles using the Microsoft Graph API.

## Features

- Create, update, and delete configuration profiles
- Modify profile assignments
- Works with any credential object implementing `get_token`

## Usage

```python
from azure.identity import ClientSecretCredential
from intune_client import IntuneClient

credential = ClientSecretCredential(
    tenant_id="<tenant>",
    client_id="<client-id>",
    client_secret="<client-secret>"
)

client = IntuneClient(credential)

profile = {
    "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.androidGeneralDeviceConfiguration",
    "displayName": "Example profile",
    "description": "Generated by API"
}

created = client.create_profile(profile)
```

Credentials should implement the ``get_token`` method. In
CI environments, configure credentials via GitHub Actions secrets and create an
appropriate credential in the workflow.
